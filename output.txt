Paper Proposal
Ever since the invention of Indian cinema, it has been an industry that is heavily based in
the upper-castes. Only recently has there been a growth of filmmakers from lower castes, such as
Dalits. One such filmmaker is Mari Selvaraj, whose films Pariyerum Perumal, Karnan, and
Maamannan all deal with different aspects of caste-based discrimination that Dalit people face.
In this paper, I will look at the history of Dailt cinema, and then closely analyze Selvaraj’s film
Pariyerum Perumal through multiple lenses. I argue that Pariyerum Perumal provides a rooted
and realistic look at a slice of Dalit life, and some of the types of oppression Dalits face. I will
also analyze the symbolism present throughout the film. Additionally, I will argue that through
the filmic medium, Selvaraj is bringing these issues to the attention of the general public,
allowing discourse to occur regarding these problems. By writing this paper, I hope to shed more
insight onto the lives of the Dalit community as depicted by Selvaraj and bring attentiosn to the
struggles they face.
